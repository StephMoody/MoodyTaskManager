# MoodyTaskManagerFinal


is a simple task manager I am currently working on for fun and learning.
 
A special feature is the ability to filter tasks. Information about which tasks are filtered will also be retained when the application is stopped. These are stored in a LiteDb.

Everyone is welcome to collaborate on this tool.
